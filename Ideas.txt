Sword's Burden

Theme:
	*** Simple ***
	Old enough for major cities to look like a stone house and a bunch of wooden shacks

Simple Ideas:
	Inventory? (
		Infinite?
		Semi-Realistic? (Limited in capacity but no side eaffects, plus can carry all weapon types for the semi noobs)
		Realistic? (
			Only able to handle a "main" weapon and a few other bits in pockets and a bag
			Weight / overencumbered?
			
		)
		Bags cannot be put inside one another
		Little option in the settings for inventory mode + tied to difficulty
	)
	Difficulties? (
		Different enemy figting styles
		Realistic health
		Realistic
	)
	Magic of any kind? (
		Spell based  / limited
		Storage bags
		Can always be added later
	)
	Gaining strength / bettering technique? (
		Strength training
		Doing the tecnique or similar techiques
		Qi / Mana / whatever control through meditation etc
		Training in relevant places
		Train with masters
		
		Have only basic techniques?
		
		Stats increase by small integer at a time
		
	)
	Monsters / fantasy setting? (
		
	)
	carriages? (
		Hire them
		
	)

Complex ideas:
	Bullet time when an arrow, etc is shot at the player (only needs to slow time for a sec so that the player can see the arrow before having to react)
	Leading and trailing attacts rather than set animations (The player can easily get used to an animation therefore having the enemy lead and trail attacks can make fights more interesting, complex and like a mind game, could end up making it to difficult if the attacks / combos are truly random so personalities will need to be implemented as an extra. Could add personality traits instead, these dictate how random the enemy is, for example an enemy with an Adaptable trait would try new techniques more often with more random timing and then try to punish the moves that have good feedback, essentially the basis of good AI)
	Character memory (Requires lots of dialog options per person) (How would this blend with the destruction of a village?, this is something to conisder especially if I delve into a set map)
	Village based economy
	Able to murder / destroy a village?
	Does that bring repricutions? (Trade / loss of city)
	More like controvertial but, what about a slight change to the stats of the user based on weird things(gender, age, backstory?, )

What would be a good missunderstanding that would explain why a nobleman would try to execute a swordsman:

	A compelling misunderstanding that could explain why a nobleman would try to execute a swordsman might involve a mix-up that paints the swordsman as a traitor or a murderer. Here are a few detailed scenarios:

	1. Mistaken Identity:
	The swordsman is mistaken for an infamous assassin who recently killed a high-ranking noble. Both share similar physical traits, and the real assassin planted false evidence pointing to the swordsman to throw off suspicion.

	2. Stolen Artifact:
	The swordsman unknowingly comes into possession of a valuable artifact that was stolen from the nobleman. The true thief plants the artifact on the swordsman, making it appear as though he is the culprit.

	3. Framed for Treason:
	A rival swordsman or enemy of the nobleman frames the protagonist by planting forged letters and documents that suggest he is plotting against the nobleman. The nobleman, in a panic, orders his execution without a proper investigation.

	4. Accidental Death:
	The swordsman is involved in a fight to protect someone or something and accidentally kills a close relative of the nobleman. The nobleman, grieving and seeking justice, misinterprets the incident as a deliberate act of murder.

	5. Political Intrigue:
	The swordsman uncovers a conspiracy against the nobleman and tries to warn him. However, the conspirators get to the nobleman first, twisting the swordsman’s warnings into false accusations of betrayal and treason.

	6. Forbidden Romance:
	The swordsman falls in love with the nobleman’s daughter, who is promised to another powerful figure. When they are discovered, the nobleman believes the swordsman seduced his daughter to undermine his political alliances and orders his execution.

	7. Cursed Blade:
	The swordsman comes into possession of a legendary, cursed sword believed to bring misfortune and death to its owner. The nobleman, fearing the curse and blaming the swordsman for recent calamities, orders his execution to lift the perceived curse.

	These scenarios add layers of intrigue, emotion, and conflict, creating a rich narrative foundation for the game
